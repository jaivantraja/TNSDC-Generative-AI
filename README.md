# TNSDC_Generative-AI

## Overview
This project aims to automate the classification of rice images using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying different varieties of rice and detecting disease symptoms from images, aiding in agricultural management and ensuring food security.

## Key Features
* Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing: Download and preprocess a dataset containing images of various rice varieties and diseases.
* Model Development: Explore and train CNN architectures using TensorFlow/Keras to classify rice images.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
* Deployment: Deploy the final model to provide a scalable solution for rice variety identification and disease detection.

## Dependencies
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* ImageIO
* Scikit-learn
